# Letter Reveal Feature - Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines test scenarios for the letter reveal functionality that allows users to reveal individual letters in the solution by tapping on blank squares.

## Feature Requirements
1. Users can tap on any blank square in the solution box
2. A prompt appears asking if they want to reveal that letter
